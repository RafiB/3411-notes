Sometimes the Contents doesn't render when you compile the .tex file. Just try it again until it works. Try to avoid pushing without the contents in there.

### Installation:

1. Ensure you can compile latex (for ubuntu, `sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra`)
2. Compile latex to pdf (`pdflatex studynotes.tex`)
